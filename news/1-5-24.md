## Announcing the Bottle Splitter

The bottle splitter is something we have a constant need for.  Often, we want to share drams from a bottle but need to organize how to share it.

Imagine a site that allows:

- A unique URL for the bottle split
- What drams and sizes are available
- People can sign up for a slot

Individuals can:

- Sign up with other providers (e.g. Google, Github, Microsoft)
- Sign up to splits
- Share address details if necessary

## Current work

The URL for this is at https://splits.steeldram.com/

Right now this is pre-alpha and development is ongoing.  Hosting will use free tiers so no one is out of pocket.
